					<h2>Version 3.0.8+</h2>
					<p>In the future updates will not be announced here but instead in the support forum.</p>
					<p>You will see <a href="http://fv-extender.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=updates&amp;thread=66">a forum thread</a> instead of this page everytime chrome autoupdates FV Extender.</p>
					<p> Of course you can still get notified through twitter or the twitter RSS feed. Just subscribe/follow at<a href="http://twitter.com/fv_extender" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" id="link_1297429220645_2">http://twitter.com/fv_extender</a>.</p>
					<p> I've made this update because it seems like some of you gets the auto update of the extension very late or not at all. Now you can instead get a message through your e-mail when the forum thread is updated and then force an update yourself and instantly get the update.</p>
					<p>So now you just need to login to the forum and bookmark <a href="http://fv-extender.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=updates&amp;thread=66">the thread</a>.</p>
					<p>Some of you have sent me some very nice words related to FVE. Thank you and once for all: I love you too :-)<br />
					</p>
<h2>Version 3.0.7</h2>
					<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Due to changes made by facebook I've made some adjustments so the popup now shows again when you click the &quot;Accept all...&quot; button.<br />
							<br />
							<br />
						If the extension does not work even after it's updated then please restart your browser and try again.</li>
					</ul>
<h2>Version 3.0.6</h2>
<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The requests for help with crossbreeding of seeds is now being accepted correctly <u>at first</u>. But keep in mind that this feature seem to be very bugged right now. So it's not at all certain the receiver will get the help or even have it listed in the list of requests. We hope Zynga will soon acknowledge this bug and fix it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 3.0.5</h2>
<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Duckling requests are now handled like  requests for help/materials.</li>
	<li>Other minor bugs/features. I'll update all forum threads concerning these so that you will get informed about these too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 3.0.4</h2>
<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All known issues in version 3.0.3 is fixed and back to normal. Read below.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Version 3.0.3</strong></h2>
<p>This release is a result of grabbing the low hanging fruits due to the health issues mentioned above.</p>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>In the future you will see this &quot;Updates&quot; page just after the autoupdate of the extension is done and the update is installed.</li>
	<li>It is now possible to disable the sounds. This way you can use the Extender without your boss wondering why his constantly hears the sound of a cow or a sheep.</li>
	<li>We've added a &quot;Just help&quot; button which makes the Extender save all requests for later except those related to simply helping your neigbors.</li>
	<li>So far the Extender has not send return gifts when accepting a &quot;Thank you&quot; gift. There is now an option to enable/disable this. The default is that it will do it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When running of out requests the Extender will now ignore the warnings and just continue to the next request and try to proces that.</li>
	<li>The lastest relaunch of the message center in FV has made some bugs. I've tried to solve these. I won't go into details since the issues wasn't catastrophic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>FIXED in 3.0.4: The relaunch of the message center introduced a couple of problems I couldn't fix just like that. They are both related to the fact that I suddenly can't proces the user text attached to a request:
		<ul>
			<li> Requests with user texts are currently not skipped.</li>
			<li>Sofar writing ex. &quot;Don't resend&quot; would have disabled the return of a gift, but this does not work.</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The new 500 gift limit in the gift box is automatically handled by the Extender but due to FV not returning the correct error messages the Extender has aborted already at 200. The issue is reported to Zynga.</li>
	<li>Some of you have been wondering why you suddenly get requests with the text &quot;Thank you for sending me such a wonderful gift...&quot;. This is not a virus but a result of the relaunch of the message center in FV. The Extender handles these requests like normal &quot;Thank you&quot; gifts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 3.0.2</h2>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>FV Extender can now automatically return a gift when accepting one.</li>
	<li>Cow sound when the proces is done.</li>
	<li>Sheep sound when the proces is aborted by FV Extender.</li>
	<li>&quot;Granted wish&quot;, &quot;Thank you&quot; and &quot;Don't resend&quot; requests are now accepted without returning gifts.</li>
	<li>&quot;New neighbor&quot; requests are skipped for manual processing.</li>
	<li>Added in 3.0.2: The toolbar promotion screen is now handled as an error screen and FV Extender redirects you to the list of game requests so the processing of requests can continue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The auto gift back feature is still experimental but I decided to give it to you anyway. I'm constantly working on making it completely stable. If you experience that the proces stops in the middle of it all please reload the page and click the &quot;Accept all&quot; button again. If it is a constant problem please <a href="report_bug.html">report it back to me</a>.</li>
	<li>If you wonder why some of you game requests just don't get accepted it might be because FV Extender skips some types of game requests automatically. Read more about this in the <a href="user_guide.html#using">user guide</a>.</li>
	<li>FV Extender does currently not run in an <a href="http|//www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95464?hl=en&amp;answer=95464">incognito window</a>. So for now you will have to play with open cards to use it :-) <br />
		Thank you Roy for reporting this bug in <a href="http://fv-extender.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=reportbug">the support forum</a>.</li>
	<li>FIXED in v. 3.0.1. When you reach your gift box limit it will currently abort say something with [BUSHEL LIMIT]. It correctly abort so you can make room in your gift box, but the message could be better. Will fix this ASAP.</li>
	<li>FIXED in 3.0.2: The &quot;Oh no It looks like all the bits got lost&quot; error screen has so far not been handled correctly. It should be handled correctly now and will return you to the list of game requests so the processing of game requests can continue.</li>
	<li>FIXED in 3.0.2: Some of you couldnt see the popup when you clicked the &quot;Accept all...&quot; button. The position of the window was simple wrong. Now it's been changed to be in the middle of the screen. That should work for everybody. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 2.03</h2>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Some important files was missing in version 2.02.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 2.02</h2>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The &quot;Accept all&quot; button should now show every time and not just some times. Also when accessed from the link to the right on the front page of Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 2.01</h2>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The &quot;Accept all&quot; button should now show every time and not just some times.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 2.0</h2>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Everything has changed  except the position of the &quot;Accept all&quot; button.</li>
	<li>The gift requests are now accepted much quicker...</li>
	<li>and much nicer :)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
	<li>FIXED: The cycle of accepting of gifts sometimes stop unexpectedly. Please reload the page if this happens. In this case the &quot;Accept all&quot; button will also be invisible.</li>
	<li>FIXED: Ignoring a gift just before clicking &quot;Accept all&quot; does not work. Please reload the page if this happens, and click the &quot;Accept all&quot; button again. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Sadly the &quot;Accept all&quot; button still sometimes not show up. I'm not sure this problem can be fixed without doing some serious changes. For now you will have to reload the page if this happens. One reload usually does it.</li>
	<li>The &quot;Accept all&quot; button will only appear above the general list of gift requests on Facebook and not at the games overview which was introduced by Facebook in September 2010. This issue has a very low priority on my list. So don't expect it to change in the near future.</li>
</ul>
