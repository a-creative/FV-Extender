# FV Extender
A Google Chrome extension that handles FB request related to the game FarmVille. FV Extender is for those of you who want to get your gifts from Facebook but hate the manual routine that follows when you try to do that. It is the closest you get to the way you would have done it yourself.

# Motivation

In september 2010 my interest for social gaming started. FarmVille(FV) caught my attention because I had in a long time wondered why it had so many users. So I decided to try it and it really was a joy to play.

However there was an element of the game that I didn’t like. In FV and almost all other Facebook(FB) game neighbors send gifts to each other through FB. These gifts end up in the FB “mailbox”. To transfer them into your game you need to click on 3-4 links for each gift to accept and send a thank-you gift. At a certain level in the game of FV I got really tired of this routine. Because I had gotten many neighbors and got really many gifts. The game makers are highly encouraging you to get more neighbors and play many of their games. But they don’t help you much against the huge amount of gifts in the gift box.

So I got the idea to create FV Extender as an extension for Google Chrome. The basic idea was to let it click the links in FB without the need of a human hand. Just one click on an “Accept all” button.

It was not intended that any of the features would in any way ruin the experience for the neighbors in FarmVille. Instead the features would focus on doing the opposite for both players and their neighbors.

# Getting started

Please don't get started. As of fall 2020 the extension has been closed down. Primarily due to the lack of time to add compatibility with a new Facebook layout. Secondarily due to Zynga announcing the closing of the original FarmVille game in 2021, which the extension was a utility.
