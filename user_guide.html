					<h2><a name="requirements" id="requirements"></a>System requirements</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Google Chrome web browser.</li>
						<li>FV Extender is tested on Google Chrome version 8.0.552.215 but should work on some earlier versions too.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2><a name="chrome" id="chrome"></a>Installing the Google Chrome web browser</h2>
					<p>Google Chrome is one of the browsers that runs Farmville(and other games made by Zynga) most smoothly. That is why this extension/plug-in is made for Google Chrome and not eg. Firefox.</p>
					<p>Google Chrome is by far also the fastest and easiest browser to install. <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Follow Google's instructions to install it</a>.</p>
					<p>You can find more information about what Google Chrome is by reading <a href="http://www.google.dk/chrome/intl/en/more/index.html" target="_blank">Google's own presentation of Chrome</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="extension" id="extension"></a>Downloading, installing and testing FV Extender</h2>
					<p>Installing an extension in Google Chrome is also very easy and can be done in a few minutes.</p>
					<p>The easiest way to start the installation of FV Extender is to click the download link using Google Chrome as a web browser. There is a link to the download page at the bottom of this paragraph.</p>
					<p>Next you will be redirected to the extension's install page at the google extension store. </p>
					<p>Next  a 'Confirm installation' pop-up will show.</p>
					<p>This pop-up window is important to notice when you install extensions within Chrome. Because it's here you get informed about what parts of your system the browser needs access to. So if the text show eg. &quot;Access to delete files on your hard drive&quot; then you better not install the extension. FV Extender does however not need that kind of access. So don't worry about getting your computer infested with virus because of FV Extender.</p>
					<p>When you have read and understood the 'Confirm installation'-pop-up you can click &quot;Install&quot; and another pop-up shows in the top right corner when the installation is done. This usually happens within seconds.</p>
					<p>Finally to test if FV Extender works you can log into Facebook and have a look at your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/reqs.php#confirm_102452128776_0">list of game requests</a>. You should hopefully see a new button with the text 'Accept all' above the list of game requests from FarmVille(if you currently have any).</p>
					<p>Try clicking it and prepare yourself for the magic of FV Extender.</p>
					<p>Download the FV Extender extension for Google Chrome <a href="download.html">here</a>.</p>

					<h2><a name="disable" id="disable"></a>Disabling FV Extender</h2>
					<p>You can disable FV Extender if you for some reason find it annoying.</p>
					<p>To learn how to disable an extension in Google Chrome  follow <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=113907">Google's own instructions.</a></p>
					<h2><a name="up-to-date" id="up-to-date"></a>Stay up-to-date</h2>
					<p>Follow us on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/FV_Extender">Twitter</a> to get all updates on fixed bugs and new features.</p>
					<p>The extension automatically updates itself at every new version. This does not happen as instantly as tweets arrive. So to force an update:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Go to this URL in your browser: &quot;chrome://extensions&quot;</li>
						<li>Enable &quot;developer mode&quot;.</li>
						<li>Finally click the &quot;Update extensions now&quot; button.</li>
					</ul>
<h2><a name="using" id="using"></a><a name="features" id="features"></a>Using FV Extender / features(3.0)</h2>
<p>If you just hate reading here is a shortcut to a feature demonstration on Youtube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqXibcYGnfs" target="_blank"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqXibcYGnfs </a></p>
<p>You will now get a walk through all the features of FV Extender and how they are used.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>The &quot;Accept all&quot; button</strong><br />
							This button only shows when there are visible game requests in Facebook related to Farmville. <br />
							<br />
							If you cannot find the button this is the exact link to the page you will find it on:
  							<a href="http://www.facebook.com/reqs.php#confirm_102452128776_0">http://www.facebook.com/reqs.php#confirm_102452128776_0</a>. Try reloading the page if you still don't see the button.<br />
  							<br />
  							<em>Clicking the button show then options window</em>. From here you basically decide what you want to do with the pending game requests. In the future this window will give you the options to only accept some requests. In version 3.x you however &quot;only&quot; have three main options:<br />
  							<br />
  							<em>Accept:</em> Click the &quot;Accept&quot; button to quickly accept all your game requests without returning a gift. This is great if you want to surprise your neighbors with gifts instead of just returning what they got for you. It's also much faster than when you want to return gifts.<br />
  							<br />
  							<em>Accept &amp; return gift:</em> Click the &quot;Accept and return&quot; button to accept the pending game requests and at the same time send a gift back. Many of you send out gifts to get the same back. FV Extender now honours this by not only making it possible but  also gives you the posibility to decide what text message to send with the return gift. I advice you to only enter a message if you really got something on your mind, because all other users of FV Extender will be forced to read this message. This does however not count for a message including the default text &quot;This gift was returned using FV Extender&quot;.<br />
  							<br />
  							<em>Just help:</em> Click the &quot;Just help&quot; button to only proces requests related to helping. This way you can quickly and maybe more often get your neigbors the building parts they need and can save the actual gifts for later.<br />
							<br />
							<em>The magic starts when you've clicked one of the three buttons</em> just mentioned. All your game requests are  then accepted one by one and you will see a status window so you know when it's done. Meanwhile you can relax and have a cup of coffee. <br />
							<br />
						<em>A muuh(cow) sound will play</em> from your speakers when all game requests are accepted. So if you turn up the volume you can actually relax in a completely different room while FV Extender is at work for you.<br />
						<br />
							<em>Gift box protection</em>. FV Extender will abort the proces if you reach your gift box limit during the accepting of game requests. You can then click &quot;Accept all&quot; again  when you have made some room in your gift box.<br />
							<br />
							<em>Bushel protection</em>. FV Extender handles bushel gifts in the same way. Wouldn't it be foolish to loose something you have asked for? FV Extender aborts the process when you have reached the bushel limit.<br />
							<br />
							A meeeh(sheep) sound will play when the proces is aborted by the system. So when you hear strange animal sounds coming from your computer it's just FV Extender that needs your attention.<br />
							<br />
							<em>Disabling sound</em>: In the initially shown option window It is possible to disable the cow and sheep sounds if your boss does not like them :-)<br />
						<br />
						<em>&quot;Shovel&quot; requests are at the moment not automatically accepted:</em> For now you will have to accept these manually and pick the gift you want for sending a shovel to your neighbor.<br />
						<em><br />
						Requests with a personal message are also skipped.</em> This way you don't miss any of these messages. Some people write some really nice messages and you don't want to miss these. Right? As mentioned earlier on game requests with the message: &quot;This gift was returned using FV Extender&quot; are NOT skipped but instead automatically accepted.<br />
						<br />
						<em>Returning &quot;Thank you gifts&quot; for &quot;Thank you gifts&quot;.</em> In the initially shown option window it is possible to enable/disable this feature.<br />
						<br />
						<em>&quot;Don't resend&quot;</em> and a like messages usually means that a neigbor want to give you something but don't want it back. FV Extender accepts these game requests <em>without</em> sending a gift back. Don't you think your neigbors(and you) would really like that.<br />
						<br />
						<em>Granting a neigbors wish</em> usually does not mean you just want the same back. Therefore these game requests are accepted without returning gifts.<br />
						<br />
						<em>New neighbor  requests</em> sometimes come from old Facebook friends. Therefore these requests are skipped so you always knows when this happens.<br />
						<br />
<br />
						<br />
						<strong>More features</strong><br />
						There are no more features for now, but the &quot;Accept all&quot; button is a great starting feature. Stay tuned for more.						</li>
