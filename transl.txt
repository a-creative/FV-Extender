To support my programming skills I always try to be rational in everything I work with. It's more important than anything else to deliver a well thought estimate that suit the type of project in front of me.

Learning from my own mistakes is also one of my main goals. Therefore I have great experience with the use of Scrum and Lean principles to optimize my own workflow and also to help others do the same.

A "problem" to me really is a "challenge" in the words most positive meaning. This allows me to use my creativity to get ideas that end up becoming beautiful master pieces in real life. To be able to use my creativity to the max is one of the things that drives me the most in the everyday work.

In general I prefer everything I work with to be beautiful.
